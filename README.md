# Marvel Comics API Project

## Summary ## 
The project goal was to extract data from a source, in this case an API, to get data, explore, clean it and create a webpage showing visualizations and exploration of the data.

Using the Marvel API I used python to connect, collect, and export data into a csv file. Afterwards I created a Jupyter notebook and used the Pandas library to create a dataframe from the exported data. Next, I created visualizations using seaborn and exported images of the visualizations. Using the bootstrap framework, I created webpages to share my visualizations, and exploration of the Data.
